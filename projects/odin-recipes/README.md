# Odin Recipes

## Project Description
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The goal is to build a basic recipe website to practice HTML skills.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ In Progress

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
- Basic HTML structure
- Working with text in HTML
- Creating lists (unordered and ordered)
- Linking to other pages
- Embedding images
- Git basics (committing, pushing to GitHub)

## Project Structure
- index.html (main page with links to recipes)
- recipes/
  - recipe1.html
  - recipe2.html
  - recipe3.html

## Future Improvements
As I progress through The Odin Project, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Adding CSS to style the pages
- Making the site responsive
- Potentially adding JavaScript for interactivity
